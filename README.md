- **No accounts or sign-ups**  
- **No server-side storage**  
- **No tracking by default**

- Shown on first visit  
- Allows enabling **analytics** and/or **ads**  
- Keeps third-party scripts blocked until consent is provided  
- Stores preferences using localStorage  

When Google AdSense is approved, you can replace the banner with Google’s **Privacy & Messaging (CMP)**.  
EU/UK/CH visitors will automatically see a certified consent prompt.

Users can reset their choices anytime via **Cookie settings** in the footer.

- **QRCode.js** — QR code generation  
- **JSZip** — Bundles contact + QR into a zip  
- **Formspree** — Handles the contact form  
- **LocalStorage** — Saves consent preferences  

All processing happens client-side.
